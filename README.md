harvest-manager
===================

The Harvest Manager is a Java application for managing (OAI-PMH)
harvesting. It is intended to allow definition of a harvesting
workflow (involving OAI harvesting and subsequent operations like
transformations or mappings of metadata between schemata) in a few
minutes using a configuration file only.

This application contains a modified version of the 
[OCLC harvester2 library](https://github.com/OCLC-Research/oaiharvester2)
([license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)),
which implements the OAI-PMH requests.


# Basic Glossary

In OAI-PMH, an individual metadata datum is called a
**record**. Clients, such as this application, that fetch records are
called **harvesters**. The server application from which records are
obtained is called a **provider**. The base URL of the provider
(i.e. the request URL without any parameters) is also called an
OAI-PMH **endpoint**.


# Building

Building this app requires JDK 11 and Apache Maven. It can be built
simply using the command:

```mvn clean install```

If you use a Java IDE, it is highly likely it also offers a simple way
to do the above.

You can also use the `build.sh` script to run a build within an environment
provisioned with suitable versions of the JDK and Maven. Requires docker.

The above build process creates a package named
`target/oai-harvest-manager-x.y.z.tar.gz` (where x.y.z is a version number).

# Running the Application

There are no installation instructions to speak of: simply unpack the
above package into wherever you like. Be sure the system can find java
however. The deployment package contains a script to start the app,
`run-harvester.sh` (for Unix systems including Mac OS X; we can add a
Windows batch file if anyone wants it). The simplest usage is:

```run-harvester.sh config.xml```

where `config.xml` is the configuration file you wish to use.
Additionally, parameters can be defined on the command line. For
example:

```run-harvester.sh timeout=30 config.xml```

will set the connection timeout to 30 seconds. This value will
override the timeout value defined in `config.xml`, if any. The first
parameter that does not contain = is taken as the configuration file
name.

If you used `build.sh` to run a build you can use `run.sh config.xml` to run this build


# Configuration

The behaviour of the app is determined by a single configuration
file. The configuration file is composed of four sections:

- *settings*, where options such as directory paths and timeouts are
   set;
- *directories*, where output paths are defined;
- *actions*, the most complex section, where actionSequences of actions can
   be defined for different metadata formats (actions include semantic
   transformations and saving intermediary or final results into a
   file); and
- *providers*, where endpoints for the providers to be harvested are
   listed.

To get a clear idea of the structure of the configuration file, see
the [sample configuration files](src/main/resources) or the 
[CLARIN configuration files](https://github.com/clarin-eric/oai-harvest-config) in 
juxtaposition with the explanation for each section below.

## Configuring Settings

The configuration parameters in this section govern the working
directory (all output directories will be interpreted relative to it);
connection limits including retry count, connection delay and timeout;
thread control settings, including the resource pool size (which can
be reduced to lessen memory footprint, or increased to speed up
processing if resources are plentiful); and settings related to
incremental harvesting.

Set the `dry-run` setting to `true` to run the harvester without making
the actual harvest requests to the OAI-PMH endpoints.

## Configuring Directories

The output paths listed in this section must each be given a unique
identifier. Additionally, the `max-files` attribute can be used to set
a limit on the number of files in a single directory. If this is
non-zero, subdirectories will be created in such a way that each
subdirectory has at most `max-files` files in it. The usefulness of
this setting largely depends on the total number of records you expect
to store in a single directory and the file system used.

## Configuring Actions

Multiple action actionSequences can be defined in this section. Each
sequence corresponds to a format specification followed by a number of
sequential actions.

The **format definition** is made up of a match type (attribute
*match*) and match value (attribute *value*). The match type is one of
```prefix```, which simply specifies and OAI-PMH metadata prefix,
```namespace```, and ```schema```. When one of the latter two types is
used, the harvest manager will contact the provider with a
```ListMetadataFormats``` query and choose *all* metadata prefixes
that correspond to the specified namespace or schema.

The **actions** are manipulations of one or more metadata records, each of
which operates on the result of the previous action. A number of
action types are available:

- The *save* action stores the record in a new file in a specified
  output directory, specified by an identifier matching one of the
  directories defined in the previous section. The attribute *suffix*
  can be used to specify the file extension (the most typical value
  being ```suffix=".xml"`). If the attribute *group-by-provider* is
  specified, a separate subdirectory will be created for each
  endpoint. By setting history param operation  will created history file.

- The *split* action split a OAI-PMH envelope that contains multiple records
  into individual record. It retains the part of the OAI-PMH envelope that
  is specific for the record, such as the date it was fetched
  and its OAI-PMH identifier,  and the actual metadata record itself.

- The *strip* action removes the OAI-PMH envelope and retains only the
  actual metadata record. Note that the envelope contains information
  not found within the record itself, such as the date it was fetched
  and its OAI-PMH identifier.

- The *transform* action applies a mapping, defined in an XSLT file,
  to the metadata record. This can be used, among other things, for
  semantic mapping between metadata schemata. See the included
  configuration files for an example. The XSLT recieves various parameters:
  1. ```config``` the configuration file used
  2. ```provider_name``` the provider name
  3. ```provider_uri``` the endpoint
  4. ```record_identifier``` the id of the record to transform

For each provider, the first format definition that the provider
supports will determine the action sequence to be executed. If one of
the actions in a sequence fails, the subsequent actions are not
carried out and an error message is logged (but processing of any
other metadata record is unaffected).

## Configuring Providers

For each provider, the following can be defined:

- The *url* attribute (mandatory) specifies the endpoint. Any URL
  parameters (for example, `?verb=Identify` is commonly included
  when endpoint addresses are discussed) are unnecessary and will be
  stripped off automatically.

- The *name* attribute specifies the name to use for the provider
  (which may in turn determine file paths, depending on other
  settings). If no name is specified, the provider will be contacted
  and the name from its `Identify` response used. If no valid response
  is received within a reasonable time, a generic string like
  **Unnamed provider at oai.xyz.org** is used instead.

- The attribute *static*, when set to true, indicates that the
  provider is static. See the section below on static providers for
  details.

- Some of the global configuration options (retry count, connection
  delay and timeout) can be overwritten for a specific provider by
  adding them as attributes to the provider element. 

- The attribute *exclusive*, when set to true, indicates that the
  provider should be harvested on its own, i.e. no other harvesting threads 
  should be active, this can be used when a provider has some huge records.

- The provider element may contain multiple *set* child elements,
  which specify the names of OAI-PMH sets to be harvested.

There is also a special case where provider names may be imported from
a *centre registry*. So far, this registry is only used by the CLARIN community.
The registry is specified by its URL. All the provider endpoints defined in the
registry will be harvested. Sometimes, it might be necessary to exclude an
endpoint from the ones defined in the registry. This can be done by specifying
its URL in the configuration file used for harvesting. In other cases
an endpoint loaded from the registry needs its specific configuration timeout,
this can be done in a similar vain as excluding. Please review the
instructions in the configuration files supplied in the package. 

# Static Providers

This app provides support for a special case: harvesting directly from
a *static* provider, as defined in the [OAI static repository
guidelines](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm).

Essentially, a static repository is a provider that only has to make
available a single XML file which contains all of their records. The
method intended by the OAI-PMH family of standards for dealing with
this situation is that the static repository uses a *gateway* to
intermediate access, so that harvesters may access their metadata via
standard OAI-PMH requests through the gateway. The OAI Harvest Manager
allows direct harvesting of the XML file, bypassing any
intermediary. This allows harvesting in a very efficient manner, as
only a single file needs to be transferred in place of possibly
thousands of individual OAI-PMH requests.

Please note that this type of use is beyond the scope of the OAI-PMH
standard and should be viewed as an option for implementation
efficiency that sacrifices some compliance with standards.

To use a static provider, specify the URL of the XML file as the
endpoint and set the attribute *static* for that provider in the
configuration file to true. Records harvested from static providers
only have a minimal envelope that includes datestamp (of the record)
and identifier but excludes request specific attributes such as
response datestamps.

# Logging

The harvester will create the directory 'log' in which log files will reside.
Alternatively, you can specify a directory for these by defining the LOG_DIR
environment variable. A log file per provider will be created, which is
convenient for debugging specific providers.

# Implementation Notes

Processing for each provider runs in a separate thread. It is not
possible to target a single provider with multiple threads (except in
the special case where sets are used; then it is possible to mention
the provider multiple times in the provider list, each with different
set(s), and the multiple references to the same provider will then be
treated like different providers).

For efficiency, thread pools containing prepared action objects are
constructed for each action referenced in the actions section of the
configuration file. Different action actionSequences share the same pool for
the exact same action. Consider the following example, assuming that
the configuration parameter *resource-pool-size* is set to 5:

```xml
    <format match="namespace" value="http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/">
      <action type="save" dir="orig"/>
      <action type="strip"/>
      <action type="save" dir="cmdi" history="true"/>
    </format>
    <format match="prefix" value="olac">
      <action type="save" dir="orig"/>
      <action type="strip"/>
      <action type="save" dir="olac" group-by-provider="false"/>
    </format>
```

In this case, a total of 15 objects are pooled for the save actions: 5
for saving to the directory ```orig``` in a pool shared by the two
action actionSequences, and 5 each for the directories ```cmdi``` and
```olac```, only used by one action sequence each.

The pooling implementation is particularly important when
transformations are used, as preparing a transformation object
involves parsing the XSLT, potentially a time-consuming process.

# Extensions

Since 2.0 it is possible to go beyond the OAI protocol and the builtin actions. To do so Java mrelection is used.

## Protocols

To add a new protocol the Protocol interface at
[nl.mpi.oai.harvester.protocol.Protocol](src/main/java/nl/mpi/oai/harvester/protocol/Protocol.java) has to be implemented. In the configuration one can tell the manager which protocol to load, e.g.

```xml
<config>
  ...
  <protocol>nl.mpi.oai.harvester.protocol.NdeProtocol</protocol>
  ...
</config>
```

## Actions

To add a new action the Action interface at
[nl.mpi.oai.harvester.action.Action](src/main/java/nl/mpi/oai/harvester/action/Action.java) has to be implemented. In the configuration one can tell the manager which action to load, e.g.

```xml
<config>
  ...
<actions>
    <format match="type" value="*">
      ...
      <action type="nl.mpi.oai.harvester.action.NDESplitAction"/>  
      ...
    </format>
    ...
</config>
```
